# Description
The e-Dictionary is very user friendly and has many other features that distinguish it from any other e-dictionary. One of the most basic features of any library is the word searching. Our dictionary uses a mixture of hashing table and AVL trees to store the data which therefore makes searching much more time efficient. The dictionary also uses linked lists for the functionality of printing similar words when a word is not found in the data of the dictionary. The dictionary can also be personalized to your preferences by adding new words to the data set and deleting impractical or disliked words. Another feature that makes this dictionary stand out is its word of the day feature. The dictionary displays a new word everyday for the purpose of improving the userâ€™s vocabulary. The word of the day remains the same throughout the day. Perhaps the most attractive feature of this library is the Word Guessing Game. The Word Guessing Game is a multiplayer as many accounts can be made, each of which are password protected. The Game uses a system of levels and points and makes word learning incredibly fun.
